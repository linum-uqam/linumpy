# `linumpy` coding standards

* We use the [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) coding standard
* OME-Zarr format extension should be `ome.zarr`, as shown in the NGFF documentation ([URL](https://ngff.openmicroscopy.org/0.4/index.html#bf2raw-layout))
* All scripts/methods should explicitly document the expected resolutions and dimensions units
